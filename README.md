Hey, scribble fiends! You're Scratch, a pixel-poppin' demon doodled into a crinkly kid's notebook. Satan's crashing the party, twisting cute critters into spooky squiggles. Grab your magic pencil and zap him out with loopy runes, ink-splatter blasts, and epic eraser swipes!
Zip through tear-stained pages, dodge paper crumples, and crack devilish doodle puzzles. All art's fresh from the sketchpad (except your glitchy glow-up), with a soundtrack of peppy pencil taps that’ll have you humming hell-tunes!
Exorcise the big bad—'cause homework just got hella fun!

### Something is waiting, come and get it
